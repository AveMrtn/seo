<h1><center>SEO Internal Link Best Practices and SEO Ranking Impact</center> </h1>

<p>When working with both large brands and local small businesses we often get asked, “What are the SEO best practices for internal linking?” or “Do internal links boost SEO rankings?”. Simply put, yes they can boost rankings, but there are caveats. Below you will find SEO best practices for internal links to help users and search engines discover content, as well as how internal links distribute ranking power throughout a website.</p>

<h3><strong>What Are Internal Links?</strong></h3>

<p>An internal link is any link that resides on a website and links to another internal page on that same website. These links can reference other pages, CSS files, videos, images, or other types of documents.</p>

<p><strong>For Users:</strong> When a user clicks on an internal link, it takes that user to another page on the same website.</p>

<p><strong>For Search Engines:</strong>When a search engine bot finds a link, it reads that URL of the page being linked to, puts the read URL in a queue to be crawled, and when ready, crawls the URL – grabbing all the content and links on the new page. A few things to note about how search engines handle internal links:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A search engine spider will continue to discover new content on a website by finding internal links to additional content, and scanning, extracting, and indexing everything it finds. Usually, this is good, but it can also cause search engine spiders to get into pages on a website that shouldn’t be accessed and indexed.</li>
	<li>Generally, the more links an internal web page has from other internal web pages, the more ranking value it gets. But, more is not alway better, because at some point adding an additional link does not add any additional ranking value – and if done excessively can have a negative impact.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Anatomy Of A Link</h1>

<p>There are 3 primary parts to any website link – either internal or external. These parts include; the URL being linked to, the anchor text, and the HTML code.</p>

<h3><strong>URL</strong></h3>

<p>This is the website address of the page being linked to. There are two types of URLs:</p>

<p><strong>Absolute URLs:</strong>This is a hyperlink containing a full URL, which includes all the information needed to find a particular site, page or document.</p>

<p><strong>Relative URL:</strong>This takes advantage of the fact that the server knows where the current document is. Thus, if we want to link to another page in the same directory, we don’t need to write out the full URL. All we need to use is the name of the page.</p>

<p><strong>Anchor Text or Link Title</strong>The anchor text has different purposes – depending on who is using the link.</p>

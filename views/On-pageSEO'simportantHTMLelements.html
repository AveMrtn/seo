<H1>HTML Code and Search Engine Success Factors</H1>

<p>HTML is the underlying code used to create web pages. Search engines can pick up ranking signals from specific HTML elements. Below are some of the most important HTML elements to achieve SEO success.</p>

<h2>The 3 Important URL Canonicalization Steps:</h2>
<h3>1. Set A Preferred URL In Your Google Search Console</h3>
<p>This requires you to add and verify every other version of your URL and then setting the one that you chose as your preferred URL.</p>

<h3>2. 301 Redirect Every Other URL To Your Preferred URL</h3>
<p>As www, non-www, http, https, and any combination of those are considered separate websites, you’re going to want to make sure that your site is only accessible from one of those. For example, if you try to access this site by typing in sycosure.com or www.sycosure.com, you’re always be redirect to https://www.sycosure.com/. As there are many different CMS’ and ways of accomplishing this, I will not go over how to do this here.</p>

<h3>3. Interlink Using Your Preferred URL</h3>
<p>301 redirects are just an extra step your browser has to go through to reach its destination, so you want your URLs to be as consistent as possible with your preferred URL.</p>

<h1>Title Tag</h1>
<h3>Why are title tags important?</h3>
<p>Title tags are a major factor in helping search engines understand what your page is about, and they are the first impression many people have of your page. Title tags are used in three key places: (1) search engine results pages (SERPs), (2) web browsers, and (3) social networks. </p>

<h1>Meta Description Tag</h1>
<h3>Why You Should Still Use Meta Descriptions</h3>
<p>Most SEO’s might find themselves asking “If meta descriptions don’t count into the rankings algorithm, why should I use them?” The answer to that is simple. Stop thinking about them as a ranking factor, and start thinking about them as a conversion factor. Here are some great reasons to still keep your meta description in mind on your website including your homepage, internal pages, blog posts, and so on. </p>

<h1>Image</h1>
<p>You include images in your articles to get people to read your text. Well-chosen images also strengthen your message. You shouldn’t forget to give those images good alt attributes: alt tags and title tags strengthen the message towards search engine spiders and improve the accessibility of your website. In this post I’ll explain all about alt tags and title tags and why you should optimize those.<br><br>You include images in your articles to get people to read your text.

In this post I’ll explain all about alt tags and title tags and why you should optimize those.<br>Note: the term “alt tag” is a commonly used abbreviation of what’s actually an alt attribute on an img tag. For any image on your site, the alt tag should describe what’s on it. Screen readers for the blind and visually impaired will read out this text and thus make your image accessible.</p>

<h1>Text Link</h1>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>Text is better than images for SEO, pagespeed, mobile, your webserver and accessibility.</p>

<h1>No followed Link</h1>
<h3>Can NoFollow links put your website at risk?</h3>
<p>The value of NoFollow links has often led to heated debates among online marketers and SEOs. Ever since Google Penguin has been rolled out, the risk of links has become a central question.<br><br>People often claim that links marked as NoFollows have no impact. Some SEOs still rely on former Google statements suggesting that NoFollows do not pass PageRank, taking this as “evidence” that spammy NoFollow links cannot put you at risk of a Penalty.</p>

<h1>Image Link</h1>
<h3>Are Internal Image Links SEO Friendly?</h3>
<p>Most SEO programs don’t register image links as internal links because they are generally perceived to have less value than text links. This isn’t always the case, though.<br><br>

Google does their best to understand the content of an image. While a stock photo isn’t going to carry much weight, an original infographic might.<br><br>

My general rule of thumb is to only link an image to another page if it is used as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A reference for another document or post.</li>
	<li>An icon or companion image for a navigation link.</li>
	<li>A technical chart or graph that needs to be zoomed in.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do link an image, be sure to use a relevant caption and ALT text, as both of these signals can indicate to search engines what the image is about and why it is there in context.<br><br> Also, don’t forget that it is best to optimize images regardless of whether they are linked, especially providing relevant and descriptive ALT text.</p>

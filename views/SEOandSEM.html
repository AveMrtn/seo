<h1><center> What is the difference between SEO and SEM? </center></h1>

<p><center> SEO is essentially a component of the larger category, SEM. According to Google’s Knowledge Graph, search engine optimization is “the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine.”

The SEO industry is continually changing due to the frequent changes made to Google’s algorithm. But, there is one aspect of SEO that stays constant: SEO is made up of On-Page and Off-Page activities. </center></p>

<h2><center> What components does SEO include? </center></h2>

<h3><center> As stated above, SEO is comprised of two different activities.</center> </h3>


<h1><center> What is search engine marketing (SEM)? </center></h1>

<p><center> According to Wikipedia, “Search engine marketing is a form of Internet marketing that involved the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine results pages (SERPS) through optimization and advertising.” SEM includes SEO tactics, as well as several other search marketing tactics. </center></p>

<h1><center> What is the main difference of SEO and SEM? </center></h1>

<p><center> The main difference between these two terms is that search engine optimization is simply a component of search engine marketing. As mentioned above, SEM includes components of paid search, such as PPC and also SMM (social media marketing).
